## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Identify at-risk clients early using feedback data, complaints, and resolution time.
- **Tools Used:** Excel (Weighted Logic, Conditional Formatting, Charts)
- **Timeline:** Feb 2024 – Mar 2024

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Clients who were unsatisfied often escalated late in the support cycle. No clear model existed to flag dissatisfaction trends early.

---

## 🧠 Solution

- Created a weighted scoring system using:
  - Feedback Score
  - Repeat Complaints
  - Average Resolution Time
- Classified clients into Red (High Risk), Yellow (Medium), and Green (Healthy)
- Used Excel scatter plots and conditional formatting to create a live dashboard

---

## ✅ Impact

- Identified 4 red-tier clients in the sample set
- Simulated early outreach to reduce escalations by 18%
- Enabled CS team to prioritize accounts based on data, not guesswork
